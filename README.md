# TITLE #

Simple Shell

# DESCRIPTION #



# ALLOWED EDITORS #

vi, vim, emacs

# DEVELOPPEMENT ENVIRONMENT #

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line

# REQUIREMENTS #

Your code should use the Betty style
Your shell should not have any memory leaks
No more than 5 functions per file
All your header files should be include guarded
Use system calls only when you need to

# OUTPUT #

Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0] (See below)

Example of error with sh:

    julien@ubuntu:/# echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
    /bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
    julien@ubuntu:/# echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
    /bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found

Same error with your program hsh:

    julien@ubuntu:/# echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
    ./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
    julien@ubuntu:/# echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh
    ./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
